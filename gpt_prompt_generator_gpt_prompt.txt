My project is called gpt_prompt_generator
The entry point to my project is called main.py. Here is the full text
# My goal is to create a Python script which iterates over a project recursively
# and copies the text of every file into a text file with some minimal text before each
# module, explaining the module

# Initialization - create write buffer, write project overview to write buffer

# Right now, only buffer is the output file

# Cleanup (write closing context, close file)

My project has a file called base_level_module.py with the following text:
"""Base level module with some docstring text"""


def base_level_fn(a: int, b: int):
    return a + b
Try to convince me that this script could be improved, and provide examples.
